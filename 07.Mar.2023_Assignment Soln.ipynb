    "\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode are three measures of central tendency used to describe the central point or typical value in a dataset. Each measure provides different insights into the dataset and is useful in various contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The mean (or average) is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\]\n",
    "where \\( x_i \\) represents each value in the dataset and \\( n \\) is the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- The mean is useful for datasets with values that are evenly distributed and not heavily skewed by outliers.\n",
    "- It is commonly used in various fields, such as economics, sociology, and psychology, to provide a general idea of the central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For the dataset \\([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\),\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{5} = 3 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- The median is useful for datasets that have skewed distributions or outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values.\n",
    "- It is often used in real estate, income data, and any scenario where outliers might distort the mean.\n",

    "### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all if no value repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- The mode is useful for categorical data where we want to know which is the most common category.\n",
    "- It is also useful in identifying the most frequent occurrences in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "### Comparison and Use in Measuring Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean:**\n",
    "   - Provides a balanced average.\n",
    "   - Affected by extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "   - Best for symmetric distributions without outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - Represents the middle value.\n",
    "   - Not affected by outliers.\n",
    "   - Best for skewed distributions or distributions with outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - Identifies the most frequent value(s).\n",
    "   - Can be used with both numerical and categorical data.\n",

    "### **Impact on Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The **mean** is **highly sensitive** to outliers because it involves summing all the data points. An extreme outlier can pull the mean towards itself, resulting in a skewed representation of the data's central value.\n",

    "### **Handling Outliers**:\n",
    "- **Removing** or **transforming** outliers (e.g., using a logarithmic scale) can help make the measures more representative of the data.\n",
