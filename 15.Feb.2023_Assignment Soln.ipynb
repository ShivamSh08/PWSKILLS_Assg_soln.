    "#### Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?<br>\n",
    "**ANS.**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a technique in Python that allows multiple processes to run concurrently, making use of multiple CPUs or cores in a computer system. This allows programs to run faster and more efficiently by distributing the workload across multiple processes. In multiprocessing, each process runs independently and can execute its own code and access its own memory space.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful in many scenarios, including:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improved performance:**<br>\n",
    "By using multiprocessing, programs can take advantage of multiple processors, which can significantly improve performance, especially for computationally intensive tasks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel processing:**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing allows a program to divide a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel, which can reduce overall processing time.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Increased reliability:**<br>\n",
    "By running multiple processes, if one process crashes or encounters an error, it does not affect the other processes, which can increase the overall reliability of the program.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplified code:**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing can simplify the code by allowing multiple independent processes to work on different parts of the program without requiring complex coordination or communication between them.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the multiprocessing module provides support for multiprocessing. It allows programmers to create and manage processes, communicate between processes, and synchronize their activities.<br>"

    "#### Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?<br>\n",
    "**ANS.**<br>\n",
    "Both multiprocessing and multithreading are techniques used to achieve parallelism in a program, but they differ in their approach and implementation.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes in parallel, where each process has its own memory space and is managed by the operating system. Each process runs independently and can execute its own code, which can communicate with other processes using interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms. Multiprocessing is useful for applications that require maximum CPU utilization, such as scientific computing, video processing, and machine learning.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading, on the other hand, involves running multiple threads within a single process, where each thread shares the same memory space and resources as the main thread. Threads are lightweight and are managed by the operating system or a user-level thread library. Threads can execute concurrently, and communication between threads is faster and easier than interprocess communication. Multithreading is useful for applications that require improved responsiveness, such as GUI applications, web servers, and networking applications.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory:**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, which have their own memory space, while multithreading runs within a single process, which shares the same memory space.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication:**<br>\n",
    "In multiprocessing, communication between processes is done using IPC mechanisms, while in multithreading, communication between threads is done using shared memory or message passing.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overhead:**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing has more overhead than multithreading, as processes need to be created and managed by the operating system, while threads are lighter and easier to manage.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:**<br>\n",
    "Multiprocessing is more scalable than multithreading, as it can take advantage of multiple CPUs or cores, while multithreading is limited by the number of available cores in a single CPU.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging:**<br>\n",
    "Debugging is easier in multithreading, as all threads share the same memory space and can be debugged using the same tools, while debugging in multiprocessing requires additional tools and techniques to debug multiple processes.<br>\n",
